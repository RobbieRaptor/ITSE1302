*2. commit 2
**Explain why version control is an important aspect of programming.
***Version control is important to programming because, it allows for a unclustered desighning experience for both colaboration and solo builds
with out it any and all edits and progress in your codes cant be tracked thus you have no way of knowing who did what, or what changes were made
in short it takes away some of the guess work with collaborative builds.
